# Word2Vec

<div>

_The second project consists of a script implementing Word2Vec and training word vectors with SGD._

## Code and Running the Tester

All code is entered into `src/run.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

`$ python tester.py`
