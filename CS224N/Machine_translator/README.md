# Neural Machine Translation with RNNs

<div>

Check Zhang et al (2020) to better understand the Cherokee-to-English translation task, which served as inspiration for this project.

In Machine Translation, our goal is to convert a sentence from the source language (e.g. Cherokee) to the target language (e.g. English). In this Project, we implement a Seq2Seq network with attention, to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system.

## Code and Running the Tester üõ†Ô∏è

All code is entered into `src/run.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

```bash
$ python tester.py
```
