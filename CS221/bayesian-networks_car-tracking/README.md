# Car Tracking üöó

<div>

This project is an adaptation of the [Driverless Car](http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.htmlhttp://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.html) originally formulated by Dr. Chris Piech.

With road accidents tragically claiming approximately 1.24 million lives annually according to a [World Health Organization study](https://en.mercopress.com/2013/03/18/in-2010-there-were-1.24-million-road-traffic-related-deaths-worldwide-says-who-report), the development of autonomous driving technology has become a critical focus in the pursuit of reducing this grim statistic. Building an [autonomous driving system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car) is an incredibly complex endeavor. In this project, we focus on one crucial aspect - the sensing system. This allows us to track other vehicles based on sensor readings, which, though prone to noise and inaccuracies, can provide invaluable information for safe and effective navigation.

## Code and Running the Tester üõ†Ô∏è

All code is entered into `src/model.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

```bash
$ python tester.py
```
