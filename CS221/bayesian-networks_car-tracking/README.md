# Car Tracking

<div>

This assignment is a modified version of the (Driverless Car)[] assignment written by Dr. Chris Piech.

A (study)[] by the World Health Organization found that road accidents kill a shocking 1.24 million people a year worldwide. In response, there has been great interest in developing autonomous driving technology that can drive with calculated precision and reduce this death toll. Building an autonomous driving system is an incredibly complex endeavor. In this project, we focus on the sensing system, which allows us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.

## Code and Running the Tester

All code is entered into `src/model.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

`$ python tester.py`
