This assignment is a modified version of the [Driverless Car](http://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.htmlhttp://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.html) assignment written by Dr. Chris Piech.

A [study](https://en.mercopress.com/2013/03/18/in-2010-there-were-1.24-million-road-traffic-related-deaths-worldwide-says-who-report) by the World Health Organization found that road accidents kill a shocking 1.24 million people a year worldwide. In response, there has been great interest in developing autonomous driving technology that can drive with calculated precision and reduce this death toll. Building an [autonomous driving system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_car) is an incredibly complex endeavor. In this project, we focus on the sensing system, which allows us to track other cars based on noisy sensor readings.

## Code and Running the Tester

All code is entered into `src/model.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

`$ python tester.py`
