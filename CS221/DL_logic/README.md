# Logic üìù

<div>

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with logical reasoning in artificial intelligence.

In this project, we explore the use of logic to represent the meaning of natural language sentences. This provides a valuable tool for translating complex English sentences into logical formulas that machines can understand and process.

Furthermore, we delve into how logic can be used to solve puzzles and prove theorems, further emphasizing the versatile applications of logical reasoning in AI. Besides this translation task, we also immerse ourselves in the mechanics of logical inference, a core aspect of knowledge representation and reasoning in AI.

## Code and Running the Tester üõ†Ô∏è

All code is entered into `src/model.py`. The unit tests in `src/tester.py` (the autograder) is used to verify a correct script. Run the tester locally using the following terminal command within the `src/` subdirectory:

```bash
$ python tester.py
```
